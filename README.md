### What is Pagination?

**Pagination** is a technique used to divide a large set of data into smaller, manageable parts called pages. It helps improve the user experience and system performance by loading only a portion of the data at a time, rather than trying to display everything at once. Think of it like breaking a book into chapters; each chapter is a page of data, and you can navigate from one to another.

Now, let's break down each pagination concept:

### 1. Paginating a Dataset with Simple `page` and `page_size` Parameters

**What It Is:**
This method uses two parameters: `page` and `page_size`.
- **page**: Specifies which part of the data you're looking at, like saying "I want to see chapter 2 of the book."
- **page_size**: Determines how many items are shown per page, like saying "Each chapter shows 10 pages."

**How It Works:**
If your dataset has 100 items and you set `page_size=10`, then:
- `page=1` shows items 1-10,
- `page=2` shows items 11-20, and so on.

**Example:**
If you're browsing a list of products:
- On the first page, you see the first 10 products.
- On the second page, you see the next 10 products.

### 2. Paginating a Dataset with Hypermedia Metadata

**What It Is:**
This type of pagination includes additional information (metadata) in the response, such as links to navigate between pages, total item count, and total pages.

**How It Works:**
Along with the data for the current page, the response might include:
- **total_items**: The total number of items available.
- **total_pages**: How many pages exist based on `page_size`.
- **current_page**: The current page number.
- **next_page**: A link or reference to the next page.
- **previous_page**: A link or reference to the previous page.

**Example:**
A response might look like:
```json
{
  "data": [...],  // the items on this page
  "total_items": 100,
  "total_pages": 10,
  "current_page": 1,
  "next_page": "/products?page=2",
  "previous_page": null
}
```
This helps users or systems easily navigate through the dataset.

### 3. Paginating in a Deletion-Resilient Manner

**What It Is:**
This approach handles cases where items might be added or removed from the dataset while navigating through pages. It ensures that data remains consistent and doesn't skip or repeat items.

**How It Works:**
- **Cursor-based Pagination:** Instead of using `page` and `page_size`, a unique identifier (cursor) is used to keep track of where to start the next page. This can be an ID or timestamp.
- **Keyset Pagination:** Uses a stable sorting key (like an ID) to ensure consistency.

**Example:**
Imagine you're viewing a list of comments ordered by the time they were posted:
- You might use the timestamp of the last comment on the current page to fetch the next set of comments. This way, even if some comments are deleted, the rest of the list remains consistent.

**Benefits:**
- Helps in handling dynamic datasets where the data can change (e.g., new items being added or old ones deleted).
- Prevents issues like missing or duplicate data entries when items are added or removed.

Pagination is crucial for user interfaces and backend systems dealing with large amounts of data, as it helps in efficient data handling and presentation.
